# Final Project

Your final project must be written using the **Flask** framework with properly designed user interface. It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the following criteria in terms of the use of **Flask**.

## Option C

*This is a low risk / low reward path.*

For a **maximum grade of C (&approx;73%)** you can follow steps 1-11 (skipping 10, email) of Miguel Grinberg's [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

By following the tutorial you should be able to build a simple micro-blogging service using Flask and related technologies.

You application must be functional and have consistent user interface.

This option is available to **individual students** only. A team must choose another option.

## Option B

*This is a path of applying existing skills.*

For a **maximum grade of B (&approx;83%)** you must develop an original web application. It must include the following components:

* At least three **controllers** (routes)

* At least three **views** (templates)

* Make use of **persistent data** - something must be stored and accessed from the database. 
  * Use *psycopg2*, *records*, or another Python DB API
  * Use *SQLite3* or *PostgreSQL* DBMS
  * Only **1 (one)** table is required

* Some type of form processing so that your application is **interactive**
  * Use *GET* and *POST* methods

* Aesthetically appealing and consistent user interface
  * Use *Bootstrap*

* Deploy your application on the web.

## Option A

*This is a path of creativity and challenge.*

For a **maximum grade of A (&approx; 93%)** your application must meet all the requirements of **Option B** and have additional complexity. It must meet the following **additional** requirements:

* Make use of **persistent data** - something must be stored and accessed from the database.
  * At least **3 (three)** tables are required

* Use one of the following:
  * *Vue* or another JavaScript framework
  * *requests* to communicate with an external API

* Develop API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages.

## Option A+

*This is a path of learning.*

For a **maximum grade of A+ (100%)** your application must meet all the requirements of **Option A** and have at least 1 (one) additional **new** component/technology. Note that you may have to learn that technology yourself.

* Access [Amazon Voice](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service) API
* Use [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) module for form processing
* Use [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) toolkit
* Use [Open Source Document Database | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instead of a relational database
* Use [NGINX | High Performance Load Balancer, Web Server, & Reverse Proxy](https://www.nginx.com/) instead of the Flask's built-in server
* Deploy on [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
* Something else (vetted by me)
