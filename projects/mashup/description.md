# Midterm Mashup

## Idea

Use any open web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and fuse them together. You must use one more API than there are members in your team (1 member - 2 APIs, 2 members - 3 APIs etc.)

Here is a non-exclusive list of web APIs:

* [toddmotto/public-apis: A collective list of public JSON APIs for use in web development.](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

* [ProgrammableWeb - APIs, Mashups and the Web as Platform](https://www.programmableweb.com/)

## Project requirements

1. Use Bootstrap for styling
2. Use JavaScript events for interactivity
3. Use JavaScript asynchronous programming to retrieve data
4. Use JSON or XML for data exchange
5. Use at least 1 API per team member + 1 API per team
6. (Optional) Use local storage or cookies
