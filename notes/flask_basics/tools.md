# Modern Web Development Tools

This guide is written for Ubuntu. Users of Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, and other systems should refer to each tool's documentation.

## virtualenv

Initialize a new virtual environment in the current directory

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

If the previous command does not work, you may have to install `virtualenv`

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Activate the environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Update `pip`

```bash
pip install -U pip
```

Install the `flask` package and it dependencies

```bash
pip install flask
```

Save currently installed packages to a file

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Installed required packages from a file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deactivate the environment

```bash
deactivate
```

## pipenv

This is an alternative to pip+virtualenv. You may use either tool.

Install `pipenv`

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pipenv
```

Get help

```bash
pipenv --help
```

Start a virtual environment (notice the command line prompt change)

```bash
pipenv shell
```

A new directory is created (XXXXXXXX are some hash), but you don't need to go there

```bash
/home/username/.local/share/virtualenvs/current-dir-XXXXXXXX/
```

Install a package

```bash
pipenv install flask
```

See installed packages

```bash
pipenv graph
```

Generate *Pipfile* (improved version of *requirements.txt*)

```bash
pipenv lock
```

Install all packages specified in the *Pipfile.lock*

```bash
pipenv sync
```

Exit the virtual environment

```bash
exit
```

## Git

Check repository status

```bash
git status
```

Add (stage) new file(s)

```bash
git add [filename]
```

Commit changes (write them to the repository history)

```bash
git commit -m 'Message'
```

Upload your local repository copy to the server (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.)

```bash
git push
```

Download updated code from the server

```bash
git fetch
```

Merge the updates into your local codebase

```bash
git merge
```

`fetch` and `merge` can be run together

```bash
git pull
```

## ssh

Generate ssh keys

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

Your identification has been saved in /home/yasiro01/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/yasiro01/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

Add you **public** key to GitHub account

## pythonanywhere

* Use a **pythonanywhere** console to clone your repository
* Deploy your app as a Web app on *username.pythonanywhere.com*
